That said, remember that not all systems were created equal. With Culligan Water, you can rest assured that you’ll get a full-service partner, quality products with durability and an established brand you can trust.</p>\n"},{question:"What are water softeners and how do they work?",answer:"<p>Water softeners are used to remove the hardness from your water. Hard water can cause buildup that leads to spotty dishes, dry hair and skin, wear and tear on water-using appliances, and more.</p>\n<p>Water softeners work through basic chemistry. The main tank of water softening systems is filled with negatively charged resin beads. Meanwhile, hard water is caused by high amounts of calcium and magnesium, which are both positively charged molecules. As hard water pumps through a water softener, the calcium and magnesium are attracted to the resin beads and removed from your water.</p>\n"},{question:"How do I choose the best water softener?",answer:'<p>To help determine which water softener is best for your home, your local Culligan Water expert will assess factors like the hardness of your water, household water usage and flow rate.

American households, private wells are still quite common, especially for households in lower-density areas. In the United States, about 40 million people </span><a href="https://ca.water.usgs.gov/projects/USGS-US-domestic-wells.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rely on domestic wells</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their drinking water,  according to the United States Geological Survey. About 3 million Canadian residents also </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/healthy-living/water-talk-information-private-well-owners.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use private wells</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to a Canadian government website.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variety of issues and contaminants can impact the ground water that supplies wells, so well water treatment through filtration and softening systems is often required. In fact, according to a recent survey from the Water Quality Association (WQA), 53% of well water users said that </span><a href="https://www.wqa.org/resources/news-releases/id/230/well-water-users-more-likely-to-consider-in-home-filtration-a-necessity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filtration systems were a necessity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for them, not a luxury. Careful observation, frequent testing and regular treatment are the best approach for ensuring water safety and softness.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look below to learn how to spot some frequently occurring well water problems and discover how you can respond to these issues.</span></p>\n<h3>Common Well Water Issues</h3>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observation is the first step to discovering potential problems in your well water. Signs you may spot include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1"><b>Scaling, soap scum and spotting: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hard water is common in wells, and it can lead to scaling or lingering soap scum on faucets, drains, showers and tubs, as well as leaving dishes spotty after washing</span></li>\n<li aria-level="1"><b>Stains in sinks and tubs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Rust or reddish-orange stains can be a sign of iron in your well water; you may also see brown, black or blue-green stains indicating other issues</span></li>\n<li aria-level="1"><b>Strange tastes or smells: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also evidence of water problems, these challenges can make it unappealing to drink or cook with your water and make showering and bathing unpleasant</span></li>\n<li aria-level="1"><b>A dry scalp or skin after showering: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with problems like dull hair, these can be signs of hard water, which can also cause damage to plumbing fixtures and water-using appliances</span></li>\n<li aria-level="1"><b>Cloudy or discolored appearance: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a sign of a water problem and can have multiple causes, such as sediment, turbidity (issues with clarity) or suspended solids</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These issues can also emerge in municipal water, but private wells are not regulated as public water systems are, as U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rules governing public drinking water systems <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/testing.html">do not apply</a> to individual water systems. Private well owners are responsible for the quality of their water and as such, are encouraged to test their water regularly and be on the lookout for indicators that there may be a problem.<br />\n<b></b></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these signs, it’s important to note that potential problems may be unobservable. Not all issues can be seen, tasted or smelled, which means that testing, even when nothing seems amiss, is still vitally important.</span></p>\n<h3>How To Test Your Well Water</h3>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seepage of contaminants from nearby pollution sources can periodically affect groundwater, impacting safety for well water users. Contaminants like arsenic can’t even be observed without testing.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/testing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">water testing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> take place annually, as well as whenever you notice taste, appearance or hardness differences. You should also test the well water if you have reason to suspect that there could be problems with your water supply, such as after some </span><a href="https://wp-preprod.culligan.com/blog/how-natural-disasters-affect-the-water-system"><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural disasters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s also a good idea to conduct a test after well system maintenance or replacements take place.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a couple of options for </span><a href="https://wp-preprod.culligan.com/blog/testing-well-water"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testing well water</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, based on your needs:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Simple At-Home Testing</strong></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free i</span><a href="https://wp-preprod.culligan.com/in-home-water-quality-testing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">n-home water tests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can test for levels of hardness, chlorine, total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, nitrates, iron and more.</span></p>\n<p><strong>More Comprehensive Lab-Based Testing</strong></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By sending a water sample back to the lab for a more complete analysis, your local water expert can help you detect other potential culprits behind any issues you may be experiencing with your well water. Testing conducted at Culligan’s IL EPA-Certified lab can identify lead, hydrogen sulfide, arsenic, copper, bacteria and other contaminants.</span></p>\n<h3>Softening and Filtration: Well Water Treatment Options</h3>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on what you observe, as well as your testing results, an expert can help you identify different well water treatment systems that can address your concerns. Water filtration systems, water softeners or a combination of the two could enhance the taste and softness of your water and improve its safety.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Water Softening</strong></p>\n<p><a href="https://wp-preprod.culligan.com/blog/what-is-hardness-in-water"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hard water</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can affect the performance of water-using appliances in your house, like your dishwasher or laundry machine. In addition, without soft water, you may notice buildup around drains and faucets and notice that your hair and your skin feel dry after showering. Water softeners help remove the minerals that cause hardness, like calcium and magnesium, to improve your water supply.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Softeners typically use salt, but salt-free conditioners are available for users in brine-restricted areas.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Water Filtration</strong></p>\n<p><a href="https://wp-preprod.culligan.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-water-filtration-system-for-your-needs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water filtration systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> improve the quality of water throughout your home for hydration, cooking and bathing.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By filtering out many contaminants, such as iron, sulfur and sediment, you can enjoy great-tasting (and better-smelling) water while also reducing the potential for rust stains and other unsightly household problems. This can also protect your clothing, water-using appliances and plumbing fixtures from damage.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people who use well water find that they benefit from using both water filtration systems and water softeners. An expert can help you determine whether separate systems or a combined solution is the right way to improve your water. You might consider one or both of the following types of filtration systems:</span><b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1"><b>Whole home: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">These solutions improve water cleanliness for all faucets in your house, addressing issues like staining, smells and sediment. By filtering water at its point of entry to your home, you’ll benefit from cleaner water no matter where, or how, it’s used throughout the home.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level="1"><b>Drinking water: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking water filtration systems, some of which include under-sink options, provide cleaner, better-tasting water from the point of use (in other words, individual sinks). These may use reverse osmosis or other methods to filter out total dissolved solids, lead, arsenic, and other contaminants that may be in your water. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about the </span><a href="https://wp-preprod.culligan.com/well-water"><span style="font-weight: 400;">well water treatment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> options available to you today.</span></p>\n',relatedArticles:[{title:"Reverse Osmosis Systems vs. Pitcher, Faucet and Refrigerator Filters: Which is Best?",link:"https://website-preprod.culligan.com/blog/reverse-osmosis-systems-vs-pitcher-faucet-and-refrigerator-filters-which-is-best",minRead:"5 min"},{title:"The Benefits of a Bottleless Water Dispenser in the Office",link:"https://website-preprod.culligan.com/blog/the-benefits-of-a-bottleless-water-dispenser-in-the-office",minRead:"6 min"},{title:"A Guide to Finding the Right Iron Filter for Well Water",link:"https://website-preprod.culligan.com/blog/a-guide-to-finding-the-right-iron-filter-for-well-water",minRead:"8 min"}],relatedTags:[],categories:[{name:"Water Basics",link:"https://website-preprod.culligan.com/blog/category/water-basics",shortName:"Water Basics",color:"#0084ff",bg:"https://wp-preprod.culligan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CategoryHeroImg-1-1.png"},{name:"Water Solutions",link:"https://website-preprod.culligan.com/blog/category/water-solutions",shortName:"Solutions",color:"#92278f",bg:"https://wp-preprod.culligan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CategoryHeroImg-32.png"}],bestWaterFilter:{show:!0,title:"",copy:"",products:[]},discoverMore:[{image:{url:"https://wp-preprod.culligan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/what-type-of-system-do-you-need-500x500-1.webp",alt:""},link:"https://website-preprod.culligan.com/blog/undersink-filter-whole-house-filtration-or-water-softening",title:"Undersink Filter, Whole-house Filtration or Water Softening: Which System Do You Need?",description:'<p>If the bad news is that something isn’t right with your water, the good news is that there is most likely a solution you can install to address your problem.<span class="excerpt-hellip"> […]</span></p>\n',minRead:"5 min",tags:[]},{image:{url:"https://wp-preprod.culligan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog_header-1.webp",alt:""},link:"https://website-preprod.culligan.com/blog/whole-house-water-filter-vs-undersink-filtration-culligan-water",title:"Whole House Water Filter vs. Undersink Filtration | Culligan Water",description:'<p>Is it time for better-tasting or harder-working water at home?

Hard water can cause buildup that leads to spotty dishes, dry hair and skin, wear and tear on water-using appliances, and more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Water softeners work through basic chemistry. The main tank of water softening systems is filled with negatively charged resin beads. Meanwhile, hard water is caused by high amounts of calcium and magnesium, which are both positively charged molecules. As hard water pumps through a water softener, the calcium and magnesium are attracted to the resin beads and removed from your water.</p>\n',cta:{link:"",label:"",target:"_self"},image:{src:"",alt:""}},{question:"How do I choose the best water softener?",answer:'<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">To help determine which water softener is best for your home, your local Culligan Water expert will assess factors like the hardness of your water, household water usage and flow rate.

much wear and tear on your water-using appliances — you may need a water softener.

Hard water can cause buildup that leads to spotty dishes, dry hair and skin, wear and tear on water-using appliances, and more.</p>\n<p>Water softeners work through basic chemistry. The main tank of water softening systems is filled with negatively charged resin beads. Meanwhile, hard water is caused by high amounts of calcium and magnesium, which are both positively charged molecules. As hard water pumps through a water softener, the calcium and magnesium are attracted to the resin beads and removed from your water.</p>\n",cta:{link:"",label:"",target:"_blank"},image:{src:"",alt:""}},{question:"How do I choose the best water softener?",answer:'<p>To help determine which water softener is best for your home, your local Culligan Water expert will assess factors like the hardness of your water, household water usage and flow rate.
